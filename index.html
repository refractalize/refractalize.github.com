            In my spare time I work on <a href="http://pogoscript.org/">pogoscript</a>, and a few <a href="http://github.com/featurist">other</a> <a href="http://github.com/refractalize">things</a>, and will go <a href="paragliding.jpg">paragliding</a> or <a href="kitesurfing.jpg">kitesurfing</a> at any given opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm interested in programming languages, interaction design, media.

            In the past I've worked for the BBC as a solutions architect on several digital video projects, including iPlayer for the iPad. Right now I run a small software consultancy with Josh Chisholm and Adrian Longley called <a href="http://featurist.co.uk/">Featurist</a>.
