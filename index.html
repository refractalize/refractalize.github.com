            In my spare time I work on <a href="http://github.com/featurist/pogoscript">pogoscript</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/featurist">other</a> <a href="http://github.com/refractalize">things</a>.

            In the past I've worked for the BBC as a solutions architect on several digital video projects, including iPlayer for the iPad. Right now I run a small software consultancy with Josh Chisholm and Adrian Longley called <a href="http://featurist.co.uk/">Featurist</a>.
